# Second test chapter

<span id="section_begin"></span>

Here's an anchor which is duplicate to the chapter1.md. <span id="in_text"></span> It should work only in non-flat backends.

Here's an anchor which will spawn a heading conflict warning only for flat backends (because that heading is from chapter1.md): <span id="final"></span>

Here are anchors which may conflict with second URLs header in flat backends: <span id="urls-1"></span> <span id="urls-2"></span>

## URLs

[section_begin](#section_begin)
[in_text](#in_text)
[final](#final)
