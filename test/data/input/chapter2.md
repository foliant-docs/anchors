# Second test chapter

<anchor>section_begin</anchor>

Here's an anchor which is duplicate to the chapter1.md. <anchor>in_text</anchor> It should work only in non-flat backends.

Here's an anchor which will spawn a heading conflict warning only for flat backends (because that heading is from chapter1.md): <anchor>final</anchor>

Here are anchors which may conflict with second URLs header in flat backends: <anchor>urls-1</anchor> <anchor>urls-2</anchor>

## URLs

[section_begin](#section_begin)
[in_text](#in_text)
[final](#final)
